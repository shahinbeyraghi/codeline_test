=== Installation ===

1. Primary: Login to your wp-admin area and go to Appearance -> Themes. Click Add New button. Click Upload Theme button,  select theme .zip file, click on Install now button. If you have any errors, use alternate method.
2. Alternate: Unzip the template file (Akaka.zip) that you have downloaded. Via FTP, upload  
the whole folder (Akaka) to your server and place it in the /wp-content/themes/ folder. Do  
not change directory name. The template files should thus be here now: /wp- 
content/themes/Akaka/index.php (for example).
3. Log into your WP admin panel and go to Appearance -> Themes. Now move your mouse over the Akaka theme to activate  it.
